            <p class="section-content">
                The game of golf is quite a puzzling sport.  While it is often not featured on the front pages of major sports sites, 
                golf is actually one of the most popular sports in the world, with an estimated fan base of over 450 million people.  
                Aside from its unseeming popularity, the very nature of the game of golf give rise to a unique culture that makes this sport remarkably unique in almost every which way.

            <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
            <p class="section-content">
                The game of golf is played on an area known as the course with an arranged progression of 18 holes.  Each hole contains a tee box to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole, a cup 11 centimeters in diameter.  Holes may also contain obstacles that the player must navigate around, such as long grass (rough), sand traps (bunkers), and water hazards.  The objective of the game is to stike the ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible.  While the origins of modern golf are not completely clear, the general consensus is that golf was first played in Scotland during the late medieval era, probably originating from the 15th century.  During this time the many of the first historical references to the sport were made, as nobles and courtiers began to pick up the sport.  During this period, golf was actually banned numerous times for distracting young nobles from their archery practice.  In 1504, King James IV, himself a golfer, decided to lift the ban.
